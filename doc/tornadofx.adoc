You can use Kodein as-is in your TornadoFX project, but you can level-up your game by using the libraries `kodein-di-framework-tornadofx-core`.

NOTE: Kodein does work on TornadoFX as-is.
      The `kodein-di-framework-tornadofx-core` extensions add multiple TornadoFX-specific utilities to Kodein. +
      Using or not using this extension really depends on your needs.

Have a look at the https://github.com/Kodein-Framework/Kodein-DI/tree/{branch}/demo/demo-tornadofx[TornadoFX demo project] to help you going further!


[[install]]
== Install

.How to quickly get into `kodein-di-framework-tornadofx-core`:
. Add this line in your `dependencies` block in your application `build.gradle` file:
+
[subs="attributes"]
.Gradle Groovy script
----
implementation 'org.kodein.di:kodein-di-generic-jvm:{version}'
implementation 'kodein-di-framework-tornadofx-core:{version}'
----
+
[subs="attributes"]
.Gradle Kotlin script
----
implementation("org.kodein.di:kodein-di-generic-jvm:{version}")
implementation("kodein-di-framework-tornadofx-core:{version}")
----
+
IMPORTANT: either `kodein-di-generic-jvm` or `kodein-di-erased` *must* be declared in addition to the `kodein-di-framework-tornadofx-core` package.
+
. Declare your `App` as `KodeinAware` and implement a Kodein container
+
[source, kotlin]
.Example: a TornadoFX Application declaration, `KodeinAware`, using TornadoFX DI as external source
----
class TornadoApplication : App(MainView::class), KodeinAware { <1>
    override val kodein: Kodein get() = Kodein { <2>
        extend(tornadoFXExternalSource) <3>
     } 
}
----
<1> Setting the `App` as `KodeinAware` will help you define a global Kodein container
<2> Define a Kodein container, accessible from almost anywhere in your application
<3> Branch Kodein upon TornadoFX dependency injection, to be able to access those dependencies through your Kodein container (see link:tornadofx.adoc#external-source[documentation])

WARNING: In order to leverage the power of Kodein and the helpers we made, you should really consider making your `App` as `KodeinAware`.

[[retrieving]]
== Retrieving

If you defined your `App` as `KodeinAware`, you will normally be able to retrieve a Kodein container, and dependencies, from almost anywhere in your code.

CAUTION: You may also want to access your TornadoFX components (such as `View`, `Fragment`, `Controller`, etc) through a Kodein container, to help you with that check the link:tornadofx.adoc#external-source[external source] section.

[[closest-kodein]]
=== Closest Kodein pattern

The idea behind this concept, is to be able to retrieve a Kodein container, from an outer class. For example, making our `App` as `KodeinAware` give us the ability to have a global Kodein container that can be retrieve from multiple places, like:

- Components (`View`, `Fragment`, `Controller`, etc)
- Nodes, graphical object of the `App`

[[closest-tfx]]
==== From a TornadoFX perspective

In TornadoFX there is no hierachy between the different components. In fact, their is no bound between `View`, `Fragment`, `Controller` or `ViewModel`, except if you handle it yourself. However, they are available thourgh the DI container of TornadoFX (and the one of Kodein if you use link:tornadofx.adoc#external-source[external source] helper), and they all have a reference to the `App`.

So, if we made our `App` as `KodeinAware`, we can get the global `Kodein` container from any `Component` easily with:

[source, kotlin]
.Example: retrieving dependency through closest Kodein container from a `Controller`
----
class PersonController : Controller() {
    val repository: PersonRepository by kodein().instance() <1>
}
----
<1> The `kodein()` function that will get the nearest Kodein container, from the `App` 

[source, kotlin]
.Example: retrieving dependency through the closest Kodein container from a `View`
----
class PersonEditorView : View() {
    val controller: PersonController by kodein().instance() <1>
}
----
<1> The `kodein()` function that will get the nearest Kodein container, from the `App`

CAUTION: All TornadoFX `Component` can access the global Kodein container ) by calling the function `kodein()`, but your `App` *must* be `KodeinAware`.

[[kodein-extension]]
== Extension of Kodein

This section will cover how we can extend the use of Kodein in a TornadoFX application, like:

- Getting control of dependency injection over TornadoFX

- Defining specific Kodein containers in a TornadoFX / JavaFX graph

- Overriding a parent Kodein container in a TornadoFX component / JavaFX node
